          My name is Anika. I’m from Dallas, Texas, and I am a senior at the
          University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
          Statistics.
          <br />

          I’ve always lived my life in quotes. A favorite is{" "}
          <i>be scared and do it anyways</i>. I’m a firm believer that the life
          we want lies in our ability to step outside our comfort zone. Whether
          its a challenging hike, pushing myself in a workout, or forcing myself
          to go skydiving, its in these moments I’ve felt the most free, because
          it shows me to never limit what I am capable of.
          <br />

          In the field of tech, I get to solve hard problems, and embrace new
          challenges and uncertainty. A daily opportunity to push boundaries and
          grow— and the reason I love this space :)
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of tech, my joys include: electric guitar solos / the hues of
          a sunset sky / moving my body / the bounce of freshly blown-out hair /
          hiking big mountains / designer indian lehangas / my color coded
          notion workspace.
